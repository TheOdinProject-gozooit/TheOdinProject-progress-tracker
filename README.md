# TheOdinProject Progress Tracker

## Introduction

### About me

With a background in computer science, I have been working in this field for several years, especially in the user support, systems and networks areas. During my studies, I had the chance to be introduced to development. Unfortunately, it didn't catch my interest at first, but the more I looked into it, the more I've been excited about it.

So I first started with the basics in Python, building some small tools for my personnal use. Then I (re)discovered web development (that I used to hate during my sudies) and felt in love with it. This is why I decided to fully immerse myself in learning web development. I came across The Odin Project which contains exactly what I was looking for: a way to learn on my own and to progress step by step in this field.

### About this repo

This repository is a homepage about my progress on The Odin Project. It contains links to all the projects I have done in relation to it.
